# Catuion
Removed `ontTap` and `onDoubleTap` from the `OrgChart` widget. Because of these, when a button on the node is pressed, running the callback is delayed, so to remove this delay both of these were removed. You can still add a `GestureDetector` in the builder method to achieve the same functionality.

# Org Chart
A flutter orgranizational chart with drag and drop, zoom and pan, search, collapse/expand, and exteremly easy to customize the node shape!
Built entirely in flutter, so it works on all platforms supported by it!

[Try it out](https://ahnaineh.github.io/)!

## Usage
To use this package add `org_chart` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages).

Don't forget to import the package
```dart
import 'package:org_chart/org_chart.dart';
```

# Implementation

If you want to redraw the nodes in the original positions
Use
```dart
orgChartController.calculatePosition();
// you can set center=false
```


If you want to change the orientation of the org chart
Use
```dart
orgChartController.switchOrientation(orientation=OrgChartOrientation.leftToRight);
// or OrgChartOrientation.topToBottom
// you can set center=false
```
